This is the repository of my CMT400 Project, for the completion of the Computing and IT Management MSc.

" The Domaine of Data Mining in Professional Environments with an Emphasis on Basketball "


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


All of the files included in my Data Mining Projection Model are included here.

- Firstly, make sure to install Python and Jupyter Notebook.


**To create a Virtual Environment & Install packages in CMD**


- Navigate to folder
- python -m venv venv
- source venv/Scripts/Activate
- pip install -r requirements.txt

**If you wish to run the model locally, and project the CSV files**

- Delete all CSV files which end with __df.csv_, these are the projection files
- Run **all** cells inside Jupyter Notebook for the file _Final Model.ipynb_
- Wait for the model to run through all players, this will take a while
- Navigate inside the directory to the folder called '_nba-stats-csv_'
the projections are called _player_proj_df.csv_
